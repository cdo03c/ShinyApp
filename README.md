# ShinyApp
This repo contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for the Cousera Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization. The app calculates the Degree Minutes and Seconds from Degree Decimal coordinates. The app allows users to input specific latitude and longitude in degree decimals and outputs the coordinates in degrees minutes and seconds. This repo contains the following additional files:

    ui.R used to generate the shiny app
    server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
    DDtoDMS.md is the Markdown file that generates the R Presenter presentation describing the shiny app
    DDtoDMS.html is a HTML compiled from the .md file, and generates the presentation hosted on RPubs here: http://rpubs.com/cdo03c/shinyappproject.
